# 🧬 Salamander Transcriptomics
I worked on this project starting from August 2023 in the Biodiversity
Discovery FRI stream at the University of Texas at Austin. I learned Bash shell
scripting while working on this project.

Our goal is to determine the modes of natural selection operating on genes
involved in the sensory systems of cave- and surface-dwelling _Eurycea_
salamanders. We will do this by analyzing substitution rates in the transcripts
of these genes. 

Since this project was computational, I took the initiative to learn Bash
scripting and create programs to make our workflow faster and easier. Most of
the programs I coded are simple. They are found in this repository. 

## 🖥️ blast
Used to create BLAST database and search for Pax6 transcripts.

## 🖥️ connecting-scripts
Used to find candidate transcripts for analysis.

## 🖥️ fasta-make
Used to make a FASTA file for the top BLAST output of every species.

## 🖥️ multi-fasta-make
Used to make a multi FASTA file for every BLAST output of a species.
